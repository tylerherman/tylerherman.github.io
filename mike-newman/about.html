  <h1>About Mike</h1>

</div>
<section class="page-body">
  <p>Mike has been proud to call Humboldt County home for the past 4 decades. Moving here to work and raise his family in 1983, Mike became invested in the community he loves and decided to put down permanent roots by opening his own Allstate Insurance Agency in 1986.</p>
  <p>In 2001, Mike sold his business and began employment with Eureka’s Shaw and Petersen Insurance Agency as a commercial Lines Insurance Broker. When the agency’s owner retired, he was hired as a Commercial Insurance & Benefits Broker at George Petersen Insurance, where he works full time.</p>
  <p>Mike’s investment in his community grew along with his children, and he spent their early years coaching youth baseball and soccer, serving as a Royal Ranger Scout leader, and as a member on both the Cutten Elementary and Winship Junior High School’s Site Councils. </p>
  <p>He went on to serve on the Board for the Henderson Center Merchants Association, as well as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Eureka Chamber of Commerce. Committed to doing his part in helping his community thrive, Mike enjoys being a part of a diverse group of local organizations, such as Southwest Rotary Club, the Humboldt Homeless and Housing Coalition, and the California North Coast Harley Owners Group.</p>
  <p>In 2010 Mike was elected to the Eureka City Council. During his four years as a City Councilmember, he served on multiple committees geared toward ensuring Eureka’s safety, growth and prosperity. As Chairman of the Redwood Region Economic Development Council (RREDC), he worked to bring more airlines to Humboldt County. He spearheaded the implementation of the Hikshari and Waterfront Trails; and continues to serve in leadership roles alongside fellow community leaders who work to address the county’s housing, substance abuse, and mental health challenges.</p>
  <p>In 2015, Mike was appointed to the County’s Citizens Advisory Committee on Measure Z and served as Chairman for the first two years where he helped direct the spending of the new tax monies the citizens voted to enact.</p>
  <p>In 2018, Mike was appointed to the County’s Planning Commission, where he still serves.</p>
  <p>When not working or volunteering, Mike enjoys such hobbies as traveling and hiking. His focus continues to be on finding solutions, making progress, and getting the job done for the people of Humboldt County. He looks forward to the opportunity to serve as your next 4th District Supervisor.</p>
