	<p>Some of the other work I've done over the years. I don't work on a ton of logos but here are a couple I put together. It&rsquo;s a combination of freelance work and projects from previous jobs.</p>

    <p>Logo I created for a flight data company, trying to incorporate the airplane into the V shape.</p>

    <p>For a little while I&rsquo;ve been working on this side project, a fantasy soccer application I'm building with a small, remote team in Ireland and the UK. I&rsquo;ve played fantasy football for a long time now and had even worked on some concepts for my own fantasy football application in the past, so when I got contact to work on this, even being a different sport, it seemed like a fun project and something I could get into.</p>
	    
	<p>First task with Fantasy Nation was creating the branding and style guide. We're actually on the second iteration of this app. This time around we're using Angular Material 2 to try and save a little time on front-end development. The audience is primarily mobile traffic so material should work fine and we may eventually get it into an Android app.</p>

	<p>Here is the desktop homepage design. Created everything for this app: the content, branding, design direction and all screens, colors, icons etc., as well as setting the marketing vision and direction.</p>
	
     <img src="img/fantasy-nation.png" class="old" alt="new homepage" />
    
	<p>Here are a handful of the screens. I started everything mobile, as that is what the majority of the audience will be using. Kept the styles fairly basic and consistent with material design as much as I could to help speed of front-end development.</p>

	<p>At one studio we did a lot of pitch decks and prototypes for people looking to raise funding. Here are a few mobile screens from two of those. Also including some general web designs from various places, going a few years back.</p>
