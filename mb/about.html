        <li>Ability to successfully brand new business for long-term recognition and growth</li>

      <h5>Professional History</h5>
      <p>Prior to attending Humboldt State, I apprenticed with General Telephone Company in Santa Monica as part of their in-house design group, producing teaching materials, brochures, charts, illustrations and promotions.</p> 
      <p>While at Humboldt I worked for the college in the media center producing teaching aids, displays and brochures and in the library doing calligraphy and bulletin board displays.</p> 
      <p>After graduating from Humboldt State in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree, I moved to Montreal where I did some display design for a cement company for trade shows. I also did display design for a photography store in an upscale underground mall.</p> 
      <p>On returning to Humboldt County I partnered in a sign business designing catalogs, signs, logos, bus system graphics (A&MRTS), posters, business stationery and advertising. My designs have stood the test of time and many are still in use today.</p> 
      <p>I began working on my own as a freelance graphic designer in 1978, and have been self-employed continuously to present day.</p> 
      <p>My body of work, created over forty years, includes corporate logos, brochures, catalogs, labels, displays, posters, signage, and promotional materials for city and county governments, retail businesses, manufacturers, and non-profit organizations. </p> 
      <p>Among my well-known designs are the Arcata bus system graphics, the Eureka Boardwalk logo and banner for the City of Eureka and the logo for the Humboldt County Convention and Visitors Bureau that branded Eureka and Humboldt County for many years. I am proud of my design for the City of Rio Dell entrance sign that created a visual identity for the city, a source of pride and tangible good feelings to those who live there.</p>
